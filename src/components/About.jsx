      <p className="indent-8 text-justify ml-4 mr-10">Our website gives you an insight about the patterns 
        and trends of MSMEs through data visualizations using the data provided by the Bank of the 
        Philippine Islands (BPI).  the contestants of BPI D.A.T.A. WAVE Hackathon gathered the data 
        from the .parquet files provided by BPI. Using the data visualizations created in Tableau, 
        the developers  found out a lot of information about the MSMEs. They have separated the Micro, Small
        and Medium business owner categories to different pages. By navigating these pages, the business owners
        will have insights on what are the benefits of taking loans, how much loans are the best for them and what
        kind of business transactions will assist them in achieving success.</p>
      <br></br>

      <p className="indent-8 text-justify ml-4 mr-10">With the different business categories in the sidebar, the
        business owners belonging to either micro/small/medium businesses will see that taking loans and getting assistance from
        the bank is beneficial for them. This will create a smooth and good relationship between the MSMEs and the Philippine banks. If the business owners are unsure if they will take a loan from the bank, there
        is a "Loan Calculator" page for them to use which will compute their desired loan amount and will measure how much will it be
        within the given loan tenure (how long they plan on paying the loan) which has a scope of 1â€“5 years.</p>
